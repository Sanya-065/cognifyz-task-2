Completed Task 2 – Cognifyz Technologies Internship (Power BI Dashboard) 🎯

I'm excited to share my second task as a Power BI Intern at Cognifyz Technologies! 🔍

📊 Task Title: Gender-Based Investment Preference Analysis
📌 Objective: To analyze and visualize the differences in investment preferences between genders (Equity, Mutual Funds, Government Bonds).

✅ What I Did:

Imported and cleaned the dataset in Power BI

Created comparison charts to visualize investment choices based on gender

Highlighted key insights and trends in financial behavior

Designed a clean and interactive dashboard

💡 Key Insights:

Males preferred Equity investments more than females

Females showed higher inclination toward Government Bonds and Mutual Funds

The analysis helps in understanding gender-wise financial decision patterns



This project helped me improve my data visualization and storytelling skills using Power BI! 💻📈
